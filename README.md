Hello everyone. I’ve read through the contributions guides and I am going to break it down for most of us that are having difficulties understanding them.

I understand that it is overwhelming being faced with lots of information and links to click on.
Below I have listed pointers to the repositories and an explanation on how to contribute.

What you need to know.
CC has different project repositories that require contribution, not just the Vocabulary repo.
As pointed out by @sara and as listed in the project list page, they include:

Vocabulary Repository (Github repo and  Documentation(Design system))
Search Portal Repository (Github repo)
Resources Archive Repository (Github repo)
LegalDB Repository (Github repo)
And others, but these are the highlighted ones.

Steps on how to contribute to a project
Once you get to the repo of any project you want to contribute to:
Click on “issues”. Go through the issues and specifically look out for the ones with the following tags or text:
      i.help wanted
     ii.good first issue
     iii. status:  ready to work


2.When you’ve seen an issue you would want to work on:
     i. You do not need to ask for permission to start working on the issue.
     ii. You do not need to ask to be assigned the issue. You can start.
     iii. Fork the repo.

How do you fork a repo?
i. When you get to the github repo at the top right hand side of your screen you’ll see “Fork”
ii. Click on the dropdown icon near it and you’ll see “Create a new fork”
iii. Click on it and it will take you to a page.
iv. scroll down and you’ll see  a button with a green background with the text “create fork”, click on it and you’ll have your copy of it in your github repositories.
3. Now, you’ve forked the repo. Create a branch.
How do you create a branch?
i. Once you fork the repo, it will take you to the repo. At the top left corner of your screen, you’ll see “Branch” (The second button).
